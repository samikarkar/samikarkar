  title: About Us
  description: After 10 years of working in universities, Sami Karkar decided to found
    his own R&D agency. Working for both academic and industrial clients, his agency
    now develops top-notch multi-physics models and simulations to help foster new
    research ideas, boost new concept development, and speed-up innovation
  content: Music acoustics, Nonlinear dynamical systems, Programable metamaterials,
    Radio-frequency components, Earth atmosphere physics... It could sound like a
    list of very disconnected subjects. Yet they're all fields where modelling is
    an essential part of R&D. And those are fields we have explored, modelling subtle
    and complex objects, connecting different physical phenmena.

  title: WE BELIEVE IN MULTI-PHYSICS
  content: |+
    Our range of expertise covers Acoustics, Solid mechanics, Mechanical Meta-materials, Acoustic Meta-materials, Active control, Adaptive systems, Smart Materials and Systems, but also Fluid Mechanics, Atmospheric Physics, Radio-Frequency ElectroMagnetics.

    We develop innovative coupled models, using different scales in space and time/frequency for each physics, when needed. We propose time-domain as well as frequency-domain analysis, modal analysis and stability studies.
